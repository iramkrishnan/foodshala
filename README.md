Each restaurant will have 50 items in their menu

Randomly belonging to 250 customers

- **5000 Order Details**

5 entries per order - denotes the number of items in that order

**PS: Seeding database can take a while, usually 2-3 minutes**

## Important Note

### Regarding Sending Email Notification

**Email notifications are sent in the following events:**

- New Customer Registers (to admin and customer)
- New Restaurant Registers (to admin and restaurant)
- New Order is placed (to customer and concerned restaurants)
- Feedback form is submitted (to admin only)

### Regarding Process Jobs

- All the emails are sent in the background without having the user wait
- This is achieved using queue jobs and Events, Listeners in Laravel
- You need to run a background process (queue worker) which will listen for any available jobs and perform the same in a queue
- This can be achieved by running:

```
touch jobs/jobs.log
php artisan queue:work > jobs.jobs.log &
```

- This will create a new file `jobs.log` which will contain the log of the jobs performed by the queue worker

### Regarding 130 unique food items

- To generate 130 unique food items, I have made a custom API with the following endpoints:

```
BASE URL --> http://food-api.ramkrishnan.live

GET /food (get the list of all food items)
POST /api/food (post a new item)
```

- To make a POST request to my API, include

```
Request Header --> Accept:application/json
Request Body (form-data) --> name:Pizza(or whatever you want to add)  
```

- Note that the API will return a JSON Error Response 422 if the food item already exists.

## Regarding Telescope

- I have installed telescope on the application to analyse or track its performance.
- It can be accessed using the `/telescope` route.
